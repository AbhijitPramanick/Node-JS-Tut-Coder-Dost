It seems like there might be a typo in your question. If you meant "Node.js" instead of "nide js," I can provide information on modules in Node.js.

In Node.js, a module is a reusable block of code whose behavior can be shared among different parts of a program. Modules help in organizing code, keeping it modular, and promoting code reusability. Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module, and you can create your own modules or use built-in modules.

To create a module in Node.js, you can use the `module.exports` object to expose functions, objects, or variables that you want to make available outside of the module. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// mymodule.js
const greeting = "Hello, ";

function greet(name) {
  console.log(greeting + name);
}

module.exports = {
  greet: greet
};
```

You can then use this module in another file:

```javascript
// app.js
const myModule = require('./mymodule');

myModule.greet('John');
```

In the above example, `myModule` now contains the `greet` function exported from the `mymodule.js` file.

Node.js also provides a set of built-in modules that you can use, such as `fs` for file system operations, `http` for creating web servers, and `util` for various utility functions.

If you have a different context or need more specific information, please provide additional details, and I'll be happy to help!
