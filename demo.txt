function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Asynchronous operation
        if (success) {
            resolve(data);
        } else {
            reject(error);
        }
    });
}

fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        // Handle successful result
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Handle error
    });
```

#### Example using Async/Await:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const data = await asynchronousOperation();
        // Handle successful result
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
    }
}

fetchData();
```
